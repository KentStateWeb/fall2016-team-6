<h2>Infants</h2>
<h3>Ages: 6 weeks to 6 months</h3>
<p>“Primary Care” is the key phrase in understanding the quality of care your
baby will receive as a part of our Infant Care Program. Each teacher is
assigned a group (no more than 4) of infants to care for. They work hand in
hand with each parent to create a specialized care plan for the children in
their group.</p>
<p>We offer a safe, warm, and loving environment affording each
Infant the best opportunities for growth. We foster this growth through
exploration of the world around them. They have access to our centers as
well as our Bye-Bye buggies and will take rides on days when weather
permits. Each child is provided with their own crib and sheets. These are
never shared by multiple students and are disinfected as well as laundered
several times per day. We use neutral cleaning products and steam to
disinfect this room limiting any harsh chemicals our infants may come into
contact with.</p>
<p>To keep our Infant room clean and germ free we restrict
access by anyone other than our Infants and Teachers. We do this in
hopes of keeping the germs of the outside world from entering the class.</p>
<p>All of our caring Infant Room Staff treat each child as though he/she is their
own. They are also trained in Infant CPR, First Aid, and we have other
staff members with Medication Administration (MAT) training.
Our teachers set goals with our parents and work with each Infant to reach
certain developmental milestones. We use educational activities that focus
on; rolling over, walking, grasping, crawling, pulling up, and mastering of
fine motor skills. Each day the Infants will take part in several group circle
times intended to aid in verbal communication and social interaction. Our
staff will engage them in singing songs, reading stories and playing with
sensory objects. Our educators also teach American Sign Language as an
alternative form of communication.
