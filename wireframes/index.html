<div class="about">
  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>Our school is designed to create a safe and happy environment for the growth and education of our children. The whole facility is bright and colorful with plenty of natural light. All classes have windows looking in so parents and staff can observe the children.
	Classrooms are designed for all age groups and they are color themed. Our school has 2 playgrounds outdoors for different age groups and one indoor play area. The equipment have been chosen with safety in mind and they are age appropriate for all the children.
</p>
<h2>Nutrition</h2>
<p>Here at CCC we understand that a healthy diet is critical to physical and mental childhood development. We have spent a significant amount of time researching all healthy organic and natural choices that are good for our children. OrganicLife stands above the rest in this very important campaign for healthier children. We know that this company is the best partner and provider of meals for our precious children.
</p>
<h2>Cirriculum</h2>
<p>We know that children learn best when they’re actively engaged. Children have the opportunity to discover their own special talents and best ways to learn while feeling valued for who they are, while having the guidance and freedom to learn in meaningful ways. We believe that all children are talented, capable and special, whether they enjoy music or math. We know they learn Science, Math, Reading and Writing concepts through hands-on, sensory-oriented activities. Creative Kidz’ unique curriculum gives children the guidance and freedom to construct their own body of knowledge in ways most meaningful to them.
